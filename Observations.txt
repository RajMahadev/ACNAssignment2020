Write your observation/analysis based on packet dropped count and congestion window plots for TCP Reno and TCP Cubic variants.

Answer:

a. The packet dropped count changes with the change in Queue Limit for the links. As the queue limit is decreased '
   the drop count increases and when the queue limit in increased, the drop count is seen to decrease.

   The drop count for TCPCubic is higher than TCP Reno.

   For example: For a Queue-limit of 10 between n2 and n3 and n3 and n5, the drop counts are:
                TCP Reno: 22
                TCP Cubic: 27

b. TCP-Reno uses slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast retransmit triggered by triple duplicate ACKs. Reno uses
   packet loss to detect network congestion.
   TCP-CUBIC congestion window is a cubic function of time since the last packet loss, with the inflection 
   point set to the window prior to the congestion event. 
   
   There are two components to window growth. The first is a concave portion where the 
   window quickly ramps up to the window size as it was before the previous congestion event. 
   Next is a convex growth where CUBIC probes for more bandwidth, slowly at first then very rapidly. 

   CUBIC spends a lot of time at a plateau between the concave and convex growth region which allows the 
   network to stabilize before CUBIC begins looking for more bandwidth.
